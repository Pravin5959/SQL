-- Table: Items

-- +---------------------+---------+
-- | item_id             | varchar |
-- | item_name           | varchar |
-- | item_category       | varchar |
-- +---------------------+---------+
-- item_id is the primary key for this table.
-- item_name is the name of the item.
-- item_category is the category of the item.
 

-- You are the business owner and would like to obtain a sales report for category items and day of the week.

-- Write an SQL query to report how many units in each category have been ordered on each day of the week.

-- Return the result table ordered by category.

-- The query result format is in the following example:

-- Explanation :
-- Step1 : As we need to build a weekly report table based on all the categories in the item, we need to use LEFT JOIN
-- Step2 : Once left join is performed, we need to use CASE WHEN and GROUP BY to aggregate the data based upon the above result

WITH items_order_extn AS (SELECT item_category AS Category,
								 COALESCE(WEEKDAY(order_date),-1) AS order_day,
								 COALESCE(quantity,0) AS quantity
						  FROM Items
						  LEFT JOIN Orders
						  USING(item_id))
						  
SELECT Category,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 0 THEN quantity END),0) AS Monday,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 1 THEN quantity END),0) AS Tuesday,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 2 THEN quantity END),0) AS Wednesday,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 3 THEN quantity END),0) AS Thursday,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 4 THEN quantity END),0) AS Friday,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 5 THEN quantity END),0) AS Saturday,
	   COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN order_day = 6 THEN quantity END),0) AS Sunday
FROM items_order_extn
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY Category;
